# Mana-Liquidizer
A small mod to allow people to exchange Botania's Mana for Liquid Mana

Now what's the point? you might ask, well that's a good question, Mana is known to be.. very annoying to control, especially if you want to use it for your modpack/expert needs, and its generation is very limited (mana only comes from generating/passive flowers).

This mod is here to change that, let's say you want it so you can melt 10 diamonds in to get 10 buckets of mana fluid, ok that's cool, now that you have mana FLUID, "what am I supposed to do with it?", good question, craft a mana liquidizer, make sure you shift right click it with a wand (to change its mode from "mana to fluid" to "fluid to mana" and vice-versa if you don't want the latter) and then your mana fluid turns into.. Mana!, now connect it to a spreader and do whatever you want with it!

Now you might've also noticed that you can use this mod to generate mana fluid out of mana, you probably know how by now, this adds lots of possibilities, for example you now can make it so you can make 1 diamond out of 1 bucket of mana fluid! How cool is that?
